Server Enumeration and Exploitation Tool
The Server Enumeration and Exploitation Tool is a Bash script that provides a user-friendly interface for performing target enumeration and exploitation. It automates several steps involved in the process of target enumeration and exploitation using Shellter and Metasploit.

Prerequisites
The following tools must be installed and configured on the system before using this tool:

Bash
Metasploit
Shellter
Usage
To use the tool, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal.
Run the script using the following command: ./server-enumeration.sh
Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information.
The script will prompt the user for the target's URL or IP address and permission to access the server. If permission is granted, the script will prompt the user for contact and personal information. The script then resolves the URL to an IP address and injects a payload using Shellter, creates a Metasploit resource script, and runs Metasploit with the resource script. Finally, the script cleans up temporary files and exits.
